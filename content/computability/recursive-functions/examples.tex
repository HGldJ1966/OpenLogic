\olsection{Examples of Primitive Recursive Functions}


Here are some examples of primitive recursive functions:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Constants: for each natural number $n$, the function that always
  returns~$n$ primitive recursive function, since it is equal to
  $\Succ(\Succ(\dots \Succ(\Zero(x))))$.

\item The identity function: $\fn{id}(x) = x$, i.e.\ $\Proj{1}{0}$

\item Addition, $x+y$

\item Multiplication, $x \cdot y$

\item Exponentiation, $x^y$ (with $0^0$ defined to be $1$)

\item Factorial, $x\fac = 1 \cdot 2 \cdot 3 \cdot \cdots \cdot x$

\item The predecessor function, $\fn{pred}(x)$, defined by
\[
\fn{pred}(0) = 0, \quad \fn{pred}(x+1) = x
\]

\item Truncated subtraction, $x \tsub y$, defined by
\[
x \tsub 0 = x, \quad x \tsub (y+1) = \fn{pred}(x \tsub y)
\]

\item Maximum, $\fn{max}(x,y)$, defined by
\[
\fn{max}(x,y) \defis x + (y \tsub x)
\]

\item Minimum, $\fn{min}(x,y)$

\item Distance between $x$ and $y$, $\left|x-y\right|$
\end{enumerate}

\begin{explain}
In our definitions, we'll often use constants~$n$. This is ok because
the constant function $\fn{const}_n(x)$ is primitive recursive
(defined from $\Zero$ and $\Succ$). So if, e.g., we want to define the
function $f(x) = 2 \cdot x$ can obtain it by composition from
$\fn{const}_n(x)$ and multiplication as $f(x) = \fn{const}_2(x) \cdot
\Proj{1}{0}(x)$. We'll make use of this trick from now on.
  
You'll also have noticed that the definition of $\fn{pred}$ does not,
strictly speaking, fit into the pattern of definition by primitive
recursion, since that pattern requires an extra argument. It is also
odd in that it does not actually $\fn{pred}(x)$ in the definition of
$\fn{pred}(x+1)$. But we can define $\fn{pred}'(x, y)$ by
\begin{align*}
  \fn{pred}'(0, y) & = \Zero(y) = 0\\
  \fn{pred}'(x+1, y) & = \Proj{3}{0}(x, \fn{pred'}(x, y), y) = x
\end{align*}
and then define $\fn{pred}$ from it by composition, e.g., as $\fn{pred}(x) =
\fn{pred}'(\Proj{1}{0}(x), \Zero(x))$.
\end{explain}

\begin{prob}
Show that \[
f(x, y) =
2^{2^{\iddots^{2^{x}}}}\raisebox{1ex}{\bigg\rbrace}
\raisebox{1ex}{\text {$y$ $2$'s}}\] is primitive recursive.
\end{prob}

\begin{prob}
Show that $d(x, y) = \lfloor x/y \rfloor$ (i.e., division, where you
disregard everything after the decimal point) is primitive
recursive. When $y = 0$, we stipulate $d(x, y) = 0$. Give an explicit
definifion of~$d$ using primitive recursion and composition. You will
have detour through an axiliary function---you cannot use recursion on
the arguments $x$ or $y$ themselves.
\end{prob}

The set of primitive recursive functions is further closed under the
following two operations:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Finite sums: if $f(x,\vec z)$ is primitive recursive, then so is the
function
\[
g(y,\vec z) \defis \sum_{x = 0}^y f(x,\vec z).
\]
\item Finite products: if $f(x,\vec z)$ is primitive recursive, then so is the
function
\[
h(y,\vec z) \defis \prod_{x = 0}^y f(x,\vec z).
\]
\end{enumerate}
For example, finite sums are defined recursively by the equations
\[
g(0,\vec z) = f(0,\vec z), \quad g(y+1,\vec z) = g(y,\vec z) +
f(y+1,\vec z).
\]
We can also define boolean operations, where $1$ stands for true, and
$0$ for false:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Negation, $\fn{not}(x) \defis 1 \tsub x$
\item Conjunction, $\fn{and}(x,y) \defis x \cdot y$
\end{enumerate}
Other classical boolean operations like $\fn{or}(x,y)$ and
$\fn{ifthen}(x,y)$ can be defined from these in the usual way.
